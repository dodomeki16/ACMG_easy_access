    <h1>PM5 novel missense at the same position</h1>
    <p>A novel missense amino acid change occurring at the same position as another pathoegenic missense change (e.g., Trp38Ser an Trop38Leu) is considered moderate evidence but cannot be assumed to be pathoegenic <b>(PM5)</b>. The different amino acid change could lead to a different phenotype.</p>
