    <h1>BP7 synonymous variants</h1>
    <p>There is increasing recognition that splicing defects, beyond disruption of the splice consensus sequence, can be an important mechanism of pathogenicity</p>
    <p>Therefore, one should be cautious in assuming that a synonymous nucleotide change will have no effect. </p>
    <p>If supported by computational Evidence, one can classify novel synonymous variants as likely benign. However, if comoputational evidence suggests a possible impact on splicing or there is raised suspicion for an impact, then the variant should be classified as uncertain siginficance until a functional evaluation can provide a more definitive assessment of impact or other evidence is provided to rule out a pathogenic role.</p>
