    <h1>PP4 using phenotype to support variant claims</h1>
    <p>The fact that a patient has a phenotype that matches the known spectrum of clinical features for a gene is not considered evidence for pathogenicity. If the following criteria are met, the patient's phenotype  can be considered  supporting evidence:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The clinical sensivity  of testing is high, with most patients testing positive for a pathogenic variant in that gene</li>
        <li>The patient has a well-defined syndrome with little overlap with other clinical presentations.</li>
        <li>The gene is not subject to substantial benign variation, which can be determined through large general population cohorts</li>
        <li>Family history is consistent with the mode of inheritance of the disorder.</li>
    </ul>
