    <h1>PS1 same amino acid change</h1>
    <p>When one missense variant is known to be pathogenic, a different nucleotide change that results in the same amino acid can also be assumed to be pathogenic. "
        However, variant may act directly through the specific DNA change instead of 
        through the amino acid change, in which case the assumption of pathogenicity may 
        no longer be valid.</p>
