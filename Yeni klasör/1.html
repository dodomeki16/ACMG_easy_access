    <h1>PVS 1 Null variants</h1>
    <p>Null variant are a known mechanism of pathogenic consistent with the established inheritance pattern for the disease. Null variants are benign in a heterozygous state', "Be cautious when interpreting truncating variant downstream of the most 3' truncating variant established as pathogenic in the literature. Such variants cannot be interpreted without a functional assay", 'For splice-site variants, the variant may lead to exon skipping, shortening, or inclosuion of intronic materials a result of alternative donor/acceptor site usage or creating of new sites. Confirmation of impact requires functional analysis by either RNA or protein analysis.Must Also consider the possibility of an in-frame deletion/insertion, which could retain the critical domains of the protein and lead to minor lenght change(PM4) or a gain-of-function effect', 'Be cautious in assuming that a null variant will lead to disease if found in an exon where no other pathogenic variants have been described.</p>
