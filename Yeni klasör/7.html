    <h1>PM3 BP2 cis/trans testing</h1>
    <p>When two heterozygous variant are identified in a gene for a recessive disorder, if one variant is known to be pathogenic, then determining that the other varinat is in <i>trans</i> can be considered moderate evidance for pathogeniticy <b>(PM3)</b>. 
    This evidence could be upgraded to strong if there are multiple observations of the variant in <i>trans</i> with other pathogenic variants. <br>
    Finding the second variant in cis would be supporting, though <b>not definitive</b>, evidence for a benign role <b>(BP2)</b>.</p>
