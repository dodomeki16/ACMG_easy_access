    <h1>PM1 mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established funtional domain</h1>
    <p>Certain protein domains are known to be critical to protein function, and all missense
        variant in these domains identified to date have been shown to pathogenic. These domains must also lack benign veraints. <br>
        Mutational hoptspots in less well-characterized regions of genes are reported, in which pathogenic variants in one or several nearby residues have been observed with greater 
        frequency. <br>
        Either evidence can be considered moderate evidance of pathogenicity <b>PM1</b>.
