    <h1>PS4 PM2 BA1 BS1 BS2 Variant frequency and use of control populations</h1>
    <p>An allele frequency in a control population that is greater than expected for the disorder is considered strong support for a benign interpretation
        for a rare Mendelian disorder <b>(BS1)</b> or if over 5% it is considered as stand-alone support <b>(BA1)</b>. 
        If the disease under investigation is fully penetrant at an early age and the variant is observed in a well-documented healthy adult individual for 
        a recessive, dominant or X-linked (hemizygous) then this is considered strong evidence
        for a benign ,interpretation <b>(BS2)</b>. <br><br><i>*If a variant is absent, one should confirm that the read depth in  database is 
            sufficient for an accurate call.</i> <br><br>
        If a variant is absent from a large general population or a control cohort and the population is race-matched to the patient harboring the identified variant, then this observation can be
        considered a moderate piece of evidence for pathogenicity <b>(PM2)</b>
        </p>
    <p>Odds Ratios (ORs) and relative risk is a measure of association between a genotype and a phenotype <br>
    An OR of 1.0 means that the variant does not affect the odds of having the disease. <br>
    Values above 1.0 mean there is positive association with variant and risk of disease. <br>
    Values below 1.0 mean there is negative association with variant and risk of disease. <br>
    In general, variants with a modest Mendelian effect size will have an OR of 3 or greater.</p>
