    <h1>PP1 BS4 segregation analysis</h1>
    <p>Segregation of a particular variant with a phenotype in a family is evidence for linkage of the locus to the disorder but not evidance of the pathogenicty of the variant itself. <br> Full gene sequencing may provide greater evidence that another variant is not involved or identify additional variants to consider as possibly causative. Unless the genetic locus is evaluated carefully, one risks misslassifying a nonpathogenic variant as pathogenic. <br>
    Lack of segregation of a variant with a phenotype provides strong evidence against pathogenicty.</p>
