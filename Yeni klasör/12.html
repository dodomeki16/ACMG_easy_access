    <h1>PP3 BP4 computational (in silico) data</h1>
    <p>Not overestimating computational evidence is important. If all in silico programs tested agree on the prediction, then this evidence can be counted as supporting. If in silico predictions disagree, however, then this evidence should not be used in classifying a variant. The variant amino acid change being present in multiple nonhuman mammalian species in an otherwise well-conserved region, suggesting the amino acid change would not compromise funtion, can be considered strong evidence for a benign interpretation. One must be cautious about assuming a benign impact in a nonconserved region if the gene has recently evolved in humans.</p>
