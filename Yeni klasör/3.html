    <h1>PS2 PM6 de novo variants</h1>
    <p>It is considered strong support or pathogenicity if the following conditions are met: <br>1-Both parental 
        samples were shown through identity testing (If identity is assumed but not confirmed, PM6 applies), 
        <br>2-The patient has a family history of disease that is consistent with de novo inheritance, <br>3-The phenotype in 
        the patient matches the gene's disease association with reasonable specificity.</p>
