    <h1>PP2 BP1 variant spectrum</h1>
    <p>For genes in which missense variation is a common cause of disease and there is very little benign variation in the gene, a novel missense variant can be considered supporting evidence for pathogenicty <b>(PP2)</b>. By contrast, for genes in which truncating variants are the only known mechanism of variant pathogenicty, missense variants can be considered supporting evidence for a benign impact <b>(BP1)</b>.</p>
