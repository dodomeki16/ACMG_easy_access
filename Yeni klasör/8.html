    <h1>PM4 BP3 protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions and stop losses</h1>
    <p>The deletion or insertion of one or more amino acids is more likely to disrupt protein function. Therefore, in-frame deletions/insertions and stop losses are considered moderate evidaence of pathogenicity <b>(PM4)</b>. The larger the deletion, insertion, or extension, and the more conserved the amino acids are in a deleted region, the more substantial is the evidence to support pathogeniticy. Small in-frame deletions/insertions in repetitive regions, or regions that are not well conserved in evoliton, are less likely to be pathogenic</p>
